1. Abstract entities based on Hero from sample, 
	- Decide how to deal out entities that there are multiple of, (i.e monsters)
2. Create containers for entities and have an update, initialize and render for the containers
	- Decide how containers exist (i.e do "chunks" own containers? If so then the hero needs to be kept track of)
3. Unify resource loading into one file, maybe lazy load and deal with lag (loading screen are bad)
4. Figure out how to modify maps at runtime
	- Look at other procedural generated games' map storage formats
	- Could make a class that extends whatever map renderer uses as a tile in order to store additional information, maybe extend map renderer as well.
	- Get proper tile set
	- Decide how maps will be loaded/generated/stored officially
5. Find a way to get tile that mouse is on
